The location features on CliffCloud are dependent on the [Geolocation API](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html) so it won't always be spot-on. Some phones preform better than others. And it won't ever be perfect.

> The W3C Geolocation API is an effort by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to
> standardize a interface to retrieve the geographical location information for a client-side device. It defines
> a set of objects ECMAScript standard compliant, that executing in the client application give the
> client's device location through the consultin of Location Information Servers, which are transparent for the
> application programming interface (API). The most common sources o location information are IP address, Wi-Fi
> and Bluetooth MAC address, radio-frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi connection location or 
> device Global Positioning System
> (GPS) and GSM/CDMA cell IDs. The location is returned with a given accuracy depending on the best
> location information source available

If reading the documentation for it isn't your thing, the gist of it is, while it's a good starting point, it'll only report the best informatio it can get. Use your judgement and any other resources you have at hand
