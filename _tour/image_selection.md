The basics (actually all of) picking images to show everyone for beta.  It's not hard, or the most important thing in the
world, but it can't hurt. 

1. **Content:** Climbers want to climb rocks, so why not upload clean pictures of rocks.
2. **Cleanliness:** The best beta pictures come from images that show the rock accurately. 
3. **Identification:** If there's a distinguishing feature nearby, get it in the frame! 
4. **Cropping:** Include as many climbs as you can in an image while keeping accuracy, typically between 3 and 6. 

### Great
> * ambient light illuminates rock evenly
> * identifiable feature in view 
> * entire boulder in this case
> * topo lines will be easy to distinguish

### Not Great 
> * washed out colors
> * distinguishing features cropped out

> ![bad example](/img/tour/badImage01.png) 

### Not so Good  
> * distracting shadows from strong sunlight
> * climber covering part of the rock
> * not that  big of a deal here
